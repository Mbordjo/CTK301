				<h2> About </h2>
				<p>
					Lost Souls was a visual novel project that I was working on at the end of my senior year in high school. It started as a quick project because my original idea was to make "Shattered Reality" (another game project I was working on. If you want to know more about it, <a href="Shatteredreality.html" target="_blank">Click Here!</a>). However, while coming up with concepts and ideas for that game, it became too time-consuming to complete it before the project's due date. So I switched gears, and Lost Souls was born. I worked alone for this project as a head artist, programmer, and story writer. The engine used to make this was Renpy, which is commonly used to create visual novel games with branching paths.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lost Souls follows the story of a boy who has severe depression and anxiety. You play as him throughout the story, going to school and seeing how he is treated (getting bullied and name-called). Your goal in the game is to either change the events that are going on by helping the boy see that life isn't as bad as it seems and that he has friends and people to live for or let the game play its course without intervention, will lead for the main character to commit suicide. This game is meant as a way to show awareness that how to treat people can negatively affect their outlook on life.
				</p>
				<p>
					The plan for this project is to complete it and implement using a phone in the game to add dialogue in a unique way. Playtesting and fleshing out the story more are some other top priorities.
