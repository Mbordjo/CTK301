				<h2> About </h2>
				<p>
					Lost Souls was a visual novel project that I was working on at the end of my senior year in high school. It first started as a quick prroject to do because my orignial idea was to make "Shattered Reality" (which is another game project that I was working on if you want to know more about it <a href="Shatteredreality.html" target="_blank">Click Here</a>!) however while coming up with concepts and ideas for that game it became too time consuming to complete in time before the project due date. So I switched gears and Lost Souls was born. I was working alone for this project as head artist, programmer and story writter. The engine used to make this was renpy which is commonly used to make visual novel games with a branching paths.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lost Souls follows a story of a boy who has severe depression and anxiety. You play as him to go throughout the course of the story, going to school seeing how he is treated, (getting bullied and name called). Your goal in the game is to either change the events that is going on by helping the boy see that life isnt as bad as it seems and that he has friends and people to live for, or letting the game play its course without intervention will lead for the main character to commit suicude. This game was ment as a way to show awareness that how to treat people can really negatively effect their outlook on life.
				</p>
				<p>
					The future plans for this project is to complete it and implement using a phone in game to use it as a part of adding dialouge in a unique way. Also play testing and fleshing out the story more is another top priority.
